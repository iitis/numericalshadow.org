In the case of a $3\times 3$ matrix there are four classes of numerical
ranges {% cite keeler1997numerical %}:

  - Numerical range with zero line segments (ovular)
  - Numerical range with one line segment
  - Numerical range with two line segments
  - Numerical range with three line segments (triangular)

### Example 1

  - The matrix
    $M=\begin{pmatrix}1&1&1\\\0&\ee^{\frac{2\ii}{3}}&1\\\0&0&\ee^{\frac{4\ii}{3}}\end{pmatrix}$
    has an ovular numerical range

### Example 2

  - The matrix $M=
    $ has a numerical range whose boundary includes one line segment

### Example 3

  - The matrix
    $M=\begin{pmatrix}1&1&0\\\0&\ee^{\frac{2\ii}{3}}&0\\\0&0&\ee^{\frac{4\ii}{3}}\end{pmatrix}$
    has a numerical range whose boundary includes two line segments

### Example 4

  - The matrix
    $M=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\\0&\ee^{\frac{2\ii}{3}}&0\\\0&0&\ee^{\frac{4\ii}{3}}\end{pmatrix}$
    has a triangular numerical range. Notice that the matrix is normal.
