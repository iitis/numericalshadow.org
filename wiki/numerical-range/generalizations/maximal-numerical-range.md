# Maximal numerical range

## Definition

Let $A$ be an $d \times d$ matrix. The maximal numerical range of $A$ is
the set: \\\[ W\_0(A) = \\{ z : A z, \\|A \\| \\|A\\|,  = 1,  ^d \\}.
\\\]

This notion was first introduced in {% cite stampfli1970norm %}. In
{% cite spitkovsky2018note %} it was shown that the maximal numerical
range of an operator has a non-empty intersection with the boundary of
its numerical range if and only if the operator is normaloid. More
properties about maximal numerical range for specific class of matrices
we can find in {% cite hamed2018maximal %}.
