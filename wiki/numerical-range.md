# Numerical range

## Definition

For any square matrix $A$ of dimension $d$, one defines its *numerical
range* (also called *field of values* {% cite murnaghan1932field %}) as a
subset of the complex plane:

$$
W(A)=\\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: z=\bra{\psi}
A\ket{\psi}, \\ \ket{\psi} \in {\mathbb{C}}^d, \\
\braket{\psi}{\psi}=1\\}.
$$

Following a common convention we denote here
the numerical range by $W(X)$, which goes back to the German term
“Wertevorrat” originally used by Hausdorff
{%cite hausdorff1919wertvorrat %}.

## Properties and examples

See section [Properties of numerical
range]({{ "/numerical-range/properties" | relative_url }}).
