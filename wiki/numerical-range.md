# Numerical range

## Definition

For any square matrix `A` of dimension `d`, one defines its *numerical
range* (also called *field of values* [murnaghan1932field](@cite)) as a
subset of the complex plane: `W(A)=\\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: z=\bra{\psi}
A\ket{\psi}, \\ \ket{\psi} \in {\mathbb{C}}^d, \\
\braket{\psi}{\psi}=1\\}.` Following a common convention we denote here
the numerical range by `W(X)`, which goes back to the German term
“Wertevorrat” originally used by Hausdorff
[hausdorff1919wertvorrat](@cite).

## Properties and examples

See section [Properties of numerical
range](/numerical-range/properties).
