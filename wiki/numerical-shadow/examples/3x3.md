# Hermitian matrices

In the case of Hermitian matrices the numerical shadow is a one
dimensional distribution.

## Diagonal matrices

### Example 1

The matrix is $\mathrm{diag}(0,3,6)$

| Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states | Numerical shadow with respect to real states |
| --- | --- |
| ![Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/complex_b1.png" | relative_url }}) | ![Numerical shadow with respect to real states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/real_b1.png" | relative_url }}) |

### Example 2

The matrix is $\mathrm{diag}(0,4,6)$

| Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states | Numerical shadow with respect to real states |
| --- | --- |
| ![Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/complex_b2.png" | relative_url }}) | ![Numerical shadow with respect to real states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/real_b2.png" | relative_url }}) |

### Example 3

The matrix is $\mathrm{diag}(0,5,6)$

| Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states | Numerical shadow with respect to real states |
| --- | --- |
| ![Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/complex_b3.png" | relative_url }}) | ![Numerical shadow with respect to real states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/real_b3.png" | relative_url }}) |

### Example 4

The matrix is $\mathrm{diag}(0,6,6)$

| Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states | Numerical shadow with respect to real states |
| --- | --- |
| ![Standard numerical shadow with respect to complex states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/complex_b4.png" | relative_url }}) | ![Numerical shadow with respect to real states]({{ "/assets/specialcases/real_b4.png" | relative_url }}) |
