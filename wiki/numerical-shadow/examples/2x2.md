# Hermitian matrices

In the case of Hermitian matrices the numerical shadow is a one
dimensional distribution.

## Diagonal matrices

### Example 1

The matrix is $\mathrm{diag}(0,6)$

# Non-normal matrices

### Example 1

The matrix is $\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\ 0&0 \end{pmatrix}.$ The shadow
resembles a physical shadow cast by the hollow sphere made of
transparent material when illuminated by a light source at infinity.

### Example 2

The matrix is $\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\ 0&1 \end{pmatrix}.$ The shadow
resembles physical shadow cast by the hollow sphere made of transparent
material when illuminated by a light source at infinity, but with screen
not perpendicular to the light rays.
