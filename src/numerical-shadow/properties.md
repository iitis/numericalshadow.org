Properties of numerical shadow
==============================

1.  By construction the distribution ``P_A(z)`` is supported on the
    [numerical range](/numerical-range) of ``W(A)`` and it is
    normalized, 
```math 
 \int_{W(A)} P_A(z) d^2 z =1.
 ```

2.  The (numerical) shadow is unitarily invariant,
    ``P_A(z)=P_{UAU^*}(z)``. This is a consequence of the fact that
    the integration measure ``{\rm d} \mu(\psi)`` is unitarily
    invariant.
3.  For any normal matrix ``A``, such that ``AA^*=A^*A``, its shadow
    covers the numerical range ``W(A)`` with the probability
    corresponding to a projection of a regular ``N``\--simplex of
    classical states ``{\cal C}_N`` (embedded in \${\mathbb
    R}^{N-1}\$) onto a plane.
4.  For a non\--normal matrix ``A``, its shadow covers the numerical
    range ``W(A)`` with the probability corresponding to an orthogonal
    projection of the complex projective manifold \$\Omega_N={\mathbb
    C}P^{N-1}\$ onto a plane.
5.  For any two matrices ``A`` and ``B``, the shadow of their tensor
    product does not depend on the order, ```` P_{A \otimes
    B}(z)=P_{B \otimes A} (z)\\; .```` To show this property define a
    unitary swap operator ``S`` which acts on a composite Hilbert space
    and interchanges the order in the tensor product, \$S(\ket{z}
    \otimes \ket{y})=\ket{y} \otimes \ket{z}``. Thus `` \bra{x} A
    \otimes B \ket{x} = \bra{x} S^{*} B \otimes A S \ket{x}\$,
    and since ``S`` is unitary it does not influence the numerical
    shadow induced by the unitarily invariant Fubini-Study measure on
    complex projective space.
