Numerical range and spectrum of random Ginibre matrix
=====================================================

Let ``G`` be a matrix of ``\mathrm{dim}\\ G=1000`` drawn from Ginibre
ensemble and let ``G_d`` be a family of matrices such that
``G_d=P_d(T)``, where ``T`` is upper triangular matrix obtained by Schur
decomposition of ``G`` such that ``G=UTU^\dagger``. ``P_d`` are
orthogonal projections \$P_d(\cdot)=\sum_{i=1}^d
\ket{i}\bra{l_i}\cdot\ket{l_i}\bra{i}``, where ``l_i\$ is a
sequence of integers from ``1`` to ``1000``. ``G_d`` are normalized so
``\tr G_d G_d^\dagger=\mathrm{dim}\\ G_d``.

In the figure red dots indicate spectrum of ``G_d``, gray area is
numerical range ``W(G_d)``, green circle has radius ``1`` outer circle
has radius ``\sqrt{2}``.
