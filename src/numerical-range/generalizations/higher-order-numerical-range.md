Higher order numerical range
============================

The rank\--\$k\$ numerical ranges, denoted below by \$\\Lambda_k\$, were
introduced c. 2006 by Choi, Kribs, and Życzkowski as a tool to handle
compression problems in quantum information theory. Since then their
theory and applications have been advanced with remarkable enthusiasm.
The sequence of papers [choi2007higher](@cite), [choi2008geometry](@cite), [woerdeman2008higher](@cite), [li2008canonical](@cite), for
example, led to a striking extension of the classical
Toeplitz\--Hausdorff theorem (convexity of \$W(M)\$): **all** the
\$\\Lambda_k(M)\$ are convex (though some may be empty), and they are
intersections of conveniently computable half\--planes in
\$\\mathbb{C}\$. Among the many more recent papers concerning the
\$\\Lambda_k(M)\$, let us mention [li2009condition](@cite) and [gau2010higher](@cite).

Given a matrix \$M\\in M_N\$ and \$k\\geq1\$, Choi, Kribs, and
Życzkowski (see [choi2006higher](@cite)) defined the rank\--\$k\$
numerical range of \$M\$ as \\\[
\\Lambda_k(M)=\\{\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}:\\exists P\\in P_k\\mbox{ such
that }PMP=\\lambda P\\}, \\\] where \$P_k\$ denotes the set of
rank\--\$k\$ orthogonal projections in \$M_N\$. It is not hard to verify
that \$\\Lambda_K(M)\$ can also be described as the set of complex
\$\\lambda\$ such that there is some \$k\$\--dimensional subspace \$S\$
of \$\\mathbb{C}^N\$ such that \$(Mu,u)=\\lambda\$ for **all** unit
vectors in \$S\$. In particular, we see that \\\[
W(M)=\\Lambda_1(M)\\supseteq\\Lambda_2(M)\\supseteq\\Lambda_3(M)\\supseteq\\dots\\quad.
\\\]
