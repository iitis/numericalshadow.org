Maximal numerical range
=======================

Definition
----------

Let \$A\$ be an \$d \\times d\$ matrix. The maximal numerical range of
\$A\$ is the set: \\\[ W_0(A) = \\left\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C}:
\\bra{x_n}A\\ket{x_n} \\to z, \\\|A\\ket{x_n} \\\| \\to \\\|A\\\|,
\\braket{x_n}{x_n} = 1, \\ket{x_n} \\in \\mathbb{C}^d \\right\\}. \\\]

This notion was first introduced in [stampfli1970norm](@cite). In [spitkovsky2018note](@cite) it was shown that the maximal numerical range of
an operator has a non-empty intersection with the boundary of its
numerical range if and only if the operator is normaloid. More
properties about maximal numerical range for specific class of matrices
we can find in [hamed2018maximal](@cite).
